# Introduction of Project
In this project, you will develop a virtual parking garage and a car motion simulator. 
The virtual parking garage is created by using the provided images. Your car will drive in the virtual parking garage and has to avoid obstacles to complete parking.  
# Grading
+ Car Model: You have to visualize the car and wheels respective to the right position and rotation. (10%)
+ Car Motion Behavior: You have to simulate the real motion behaviors (15%)
+ Keyboard Control: User are allowed to speed up, slow down, reverse, and turn left or right. (15%)
+ Collision Detection: You need to include the functions for collision detection and the visual reaction when the car is collided with obstacles or other cars. (10%)
+ Parking Simulation: You have to provide two different parking space, parallel parking and reverse parking. And you need to detect whether the car is completely parking inside the parking space. (25%)
+ Written Report: In the written report, you have to briefly explain the major functions you have developed and list the snapshots of them (at least one for each function). If you would like to obtain extra credits, please also list the additional works you have done. Finally, make a list to explain the work division of your team. (25%)
+ Extra Credits: The following works might obtain up to 10% extra credits. 
Fancy scenes rendering – reactions, color changing, or other special effect to present the situations during the simulation. 
Parking assistant – assistants like reversing radar, reversing camera, parking area check, or even auto parking system.
